H: So can you please introduce yourself?
<br>
<br>
J: I’m Jiwon Kim. I’m from South Korea and I’m going to CCA, majoring in industrial design. I’ve been in CCA for two years
<br>
<br>
H: Thank you. So what is your relationship with face filters?
<br>
<br>
J: Face filters? I use them for selfies
<br>
<br>
H: How do you use them for selfies?
<br>
<br>
J: There are so many cute face filters in specific apps and I just use that. 
<br>
<br>
H: So you use them for the cute face filters? 
<br>
<br>
J: Yes
<br>
<br>
H: Oh. Do you feel more comfortable using a face filter or do you feel more comfortable using just a normal camera?
<br>
<br>
J: Hmm. I feel comfortable using a face filter because it helps to hide my you know?
<br>
<br>
H: Your face?
<br>
<br>
J: No like my insecurities 
<br>
<br>
H: Your insecurities? Oh I see. Do you think that face filters are too extreme as in people can catfish with face filters? Or do you think it’s okay for people to catfish using face filters?
<br>
<br>
J: Like why not? I think it’s free will. 
<br>
<br>
H: I see. So what would happen if you planned to meet someone but their face filter picture looks completely makes their face look so different. So when you meet them in person you’re like “who's that?”. What would happen? Would you run away? 
<br>
<br>
J: No? I wouldn’t think anything about it. I don’t know. I don’t think it disguises people. I think it’s just for fun.  
<br>
<br>
H: In South Korea, face filters are very popular right? Why do you think they’re so popular in Korea?
<br>
<br>
J: Hm.. Maybe, I think, people care about their appearance too much. They just want to hide their insecurities. And at the same time, people don’t want to hear bad comments about their faces. 
<br>
<br>
H: That’s true. So they would fix what they think is an insecurity, 
<br>
<br>
J: I don’t know if this is related to face filters or not but I saw a singer. She’s a youtube singer. A virtual singer. But it totally looks like a person. A real person. Looks like a natural person but actually, she uses a face filter or a slight filter on top. It’s very natural. Usually, she doesn't have double eyelids. Just completely a different person. But with the face filter, she has double eyelids and she looks completely different. It’s all so natural though. She thinks, however, she needs to apply filters so she could have more confidence and she can become a singer. With the filter, she doesn't have to think about her appearance. 
<br>
<br>
H: Oh yeah, Because appearance is very important for celebrities to become popular. And in South Korea, a lot of females use face filters
<br>
<br>
J: Yes she is also
<br>
<br>
H: a female?
<br>
<br>
J: Yes. 
<br>
<br>
H: Do a lot of Korean males also use face filters?
<br>
<br>
J: I have no idea. Probably?
<br>
<br>
H: Probably right?
<br>
<br>
J: If girls use it, guys probably do too. 
<br>
<br>
H: Oh really?
<br>
<br>
J: I think they’d use it similarly. 
<br>
<br>
H: Oh of your friends, do both your female and male friends use face filters?
<br>
<br>
J: Yes.
<br>
<br>
H: Ohh. What’s like the coolest face filter you’ve seen so far?
<br>
<br>
J: Uhh… Uhh... 
<br>
<br>
H: Is it the snail one?
<br>
<br>
J: That one's nice. I think I like the funny filters.
<br>
<br>
H: Oh the funniest one? The face morphing one?
<br>
<br>
J: The one I showed you last time. The dumpling.
<br>
<br>
H: Oh that one is really funny too. I agree. My favorite is the banana one.
<br>
<br>
J: Yes right. The banana is cute too. I like all the funny ones. I also like the one where only the eyes and mouth appears. The one I use all the time. 
<br>
<br>
H: Oh yeah. I know which one you’re talking about now. That one is also fun to use, I like how it makes your eyes and mouth look huge but blurs the whole skin. 
<br>
<br>
J: Oh yeah. It reminds me of annoying orange. 
<br>
<br>
H: Oh yeah. It does. Like an annoying person. Yeah, they’re so fun to use. I feel like they’re especially fun when you’re communicating with someone (friends) and you just send them random ones. If you could create a face filter, what would you create?
<br>
<br>
J: I would create a fun one. Let me think about it. What should I do? I want to make a funny one. Uh.
<br>
<br>
H: I’m like looking right behind you and there’s a little Mr. Potato Head Man. It’d be really interesting if you could make yourself a Mr. Potato head. 
<br>
<br>
J: Ohh. Or maybe. I don’t know if it already exists but the eyes move like this (eyes rotate) then the mouth moves like this (rotating movement)
<br>
<br>
H: Oh yeah. Sort of like distorted?
<br>
<br>
J: Yes. 
<br>
<br>
H: Would you put it on a potato still?
<br>
<br>
J: Like Mr. Potato 
<br>
<br>
H: inspired, Yeah I think it would be really fun if you could move around your ear and yeah. There’s a lot of unmade face filters so that might not be made. Making it apparently is not that difficult but 
<br>
<br>
J: Oh really?
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah., You can just draw it out and there’s a program where you can digitally make it and done. 
<br>
<br>
J: Oh that sounds good!
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah! That’s why a lot of random people on Instagram create face filters.
<br>
<br>
J: Oh that’s how they make... I see
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah… So when was the first time you used face filters? Like what app did you use?
<br>
<br>
J: B612 in middle school  
<br>
<br>
H: Oh really? Do you remember a long time ago snow was like Snapchat. So you could message your friends on snow.
<br>
<br>
J: Oh really?!
<br>
<br>
H: yeah that was a thing but they completely got rid of it 
<br>
<br>
J: What…?
<br>
<br>
H: And it was really fun too because snow filters are prettier in my opinion. 
<br>
<br>
J: Oh i didn’t know that..
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah and I was really upset when they completely got rid of that function 
<br>
<br>
J: Ohh. Why did they do that?
<br>
<br>
H: But it came out in Strongwoman do bong soon. Well, there was a scene where they used snow to communicate with face filters. Oh, also global playlist. 
<br>
<br>
J: Oh, I think I vaguely remember that happening. 
<br>
<br>
H: I think so. 
<br>
<br>
J: I think I saw it at a quick glance.  
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah, it was like a thing but they completely got rid of it. So now you can’t really 
<br>
<br>
J: Yeah! Oh yeah! I saw the tv show a few years later and I was like, “You can call while using the filter?” I thought that! Yeah. 
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah, they’re like walking down the street and they’re like using face filters and everything and you can give people face filters too. Why did they get rid of that? 
<br>
<br>
J: Right
<br>
<br>
H: Did Snapchat sue them or something? 
<br>
<br>
J: It would be fun to use with a boyfriend.
<br>
<br>
H: Exactly, that’s how they advertised it. “Oh I’m going to put a cute face filter on you but then it’s super ugly. And I was like, “what a good advertisement.”  I feel like a lot of people would’ve used snow for that reason 
<br>
<br>
J: Yeah, I think that would be nice. Why? 
<br>
<br>
H: Yeah
<br>
<br>
J: Slightly wasteful 
<br>
<br>
H: I know right? It would’ve been really fun. Well, that’s pretty much it. I think I have enough words now. Okay, thank you!
<br>
<br>
J: Thank you! Wait, what is this for?
